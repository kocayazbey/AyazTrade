# AyazTrade Disaster Recovery Runbook

## Purpose
This document outlines procedures for disaster recovery (DR) scenarios, including data loss, system failures, security breaches, and catastrophic events.

## Recovery Objectives

### RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- Tier 1 (Critical): 1 hour
- Tier 2 (Important): 4 hours
- Tier 3 (Standard): 24 hours

### RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- Database: 15 minutes (automated backups every 15 min)
- File Storage: 1 hour (backup every hour)
- Configuration: Real-time (version controlled)

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups
1. **Database Backups**
   - Frequency: Every 15 minutes
   - Retention: 7 days rolling, 4 weekly, 12 monthly
   - Location: AWS S3 with encryption
   - Verification: Automated test restore weekly

2. **File Storage Backups**
   - Frequency: Hourly
   - Retention: 24 hours, 7 daily, 4 weekly
   - Location: AWS S3 with versioning

3. **Configuration Backups**
   - Frequency: Real-time (Git commit)
   - Retention: Indefinite
   - Location: GitHub private repository

### Manual Backup Trigger
```bash
# Immediate database backup
./scripts/backup-database.sh

# Verify latest backup
./scripts/verify-latest-backup.sh
```

## DR Scenarios and Procedures

### Scenario 1: Database Corruption
**Symptoms:** Application errors, failed queries, data inconsistencies

**Procedure:**
1. Stop application: `kubectl scale deployment ayaztrade-api --replicas=0`
2. Identify last good backup: `./scripts/list-backups.sh database`
3. Restore from backup: `./scripts/restore-database-safe.sh <backup-id>`
4. Verify data integrity
5. Start application: `kubectl scale deployment ayaztrade-api --replicas=3`
6. Monitor for 1 hour

**Estimated Recovery Time:** 30-60 minutes

### Scenario 2: Complete System Failure
**Symptoms:** All services down, infrastructure unavailable

**Procedure:**
1. Activate DR site (failover to secondary region)
2. Update DNS records
3. Restore database to last backup
4. Deploy application from latest Docker image
5. Run health checks on all services
6. Notify users via status page

**Estimated Recovery Time:** 2-4 hours

### Scenario 3: Security Breach
**Symptoms:** Unauthorized access, suspicious activity, data exfiltration

**Procedure:**
1. Immediately disconnect compromised systems
2. Preserve evidence (log all activities)
3. Notify security team and management
4. Assess scope of breach
5. Reset all credentials and tokens
6. Apply security patches
7. Restore from clean backup if necessary
8. Document incident and lessons learned

**Estimated Recovery Time:** 4-12 hours

### Scenario 4: Data Deletion (Accidental)
**Symptoms:** Missing records, failed queries, user reports

**Procedure:**
1. Stop application writes immediately
2. Identify deletion time from audit logs
3. Restore from backup just before deletion
4. Export affected tables from backup
5. Merge restored data with current state
6. Verify data integrity
7. Resume normal operations

**Estimated Recovery Time:** 1-2 hours

### Scenario 5: Region Failure (Cloud Provider)
**Symptoms:** Complete regional outage

**Procedure:**
1. Activate secondary region (multi-region failover)
2. Update DNS to secondary region
3. Ensure database replication is active
4. Scale up services in secondary region
5. Monitor performance and costs
6. Plan primary region recovery
7. Fail back when primary is restored

**Estimated Recovery Time:** 30-60 minutes (with automated failover)

## DR Testing Schedule
